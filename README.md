&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This project was made in order to highlight different effects that are possible with fragment shaders on pre-rendered video. The video is turned into a texture of itself and modified in its fragment shaders to change the visual effect. Black and white filter is implemented by limiting the color range. Fish eye filter is a change made to the center of the texture so it takes up a greater area. Ripple is a time-based animation that modifies based on fragment position and a cosine wave. Toonify generalizes the color range into a range of 5 values and blends out the detail. The custom filter is a vignette filter set to change with time. The center of the image is untouched but overtime the center's radius decreases and the edges turn darker.
